TAOMINA ~ tao-mina:

tao: [道 dào; chin.]: “way“, “street“, “path“ or “method”, “principal”, “the right way”

Dào describes a principal of creation. In philosophy it is the fountain for unity and duality. Yīn and Yáng are created out of Dao, and through the interaction of the two movements, change, and mutual penetration manifest, and with it, the world.
The Dào is a world-principal, which cannot be explained rationally. The human being takes part in the Dào, and every thing, and being around us has its own Dào. Every being is on its way, each unique with its changes and developments, which point at the experience of existance rather than the comprehension of static intellectual concepts.
